Deviations in text, order and number of rk mantras started giving rise to different Sakha-Samhita from the time of Acarya Paila; Patanjali referring to twenty- one Sakha-Samhita of the Rgveda.\nThis publication is an attempt to examine the existence of Sakha-Samhita of the Rgveda as mentioned by the Puranas, Patanjali, Mahidasa and other authorities, scrutinizing textual evidence in support of them. The focus is, however, on the Asvalayana-Samhita, with a background on Acarya Asvalayana and exploring the antiquity, treatment of accent and Padapatha of the text by referring to various sources. Published in two volumes it presents a detailed and systematic study of the full text of the Asvalayana-Samhita of the Rgveda.\nThe verses of the ten Mandalas are given in original form and examined critically in a thorough study. The additional mantras of the Asvalayana-Samhita are also presented with the original Sanskrit verses followed by their translation in Hindi and English.
