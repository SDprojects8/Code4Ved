Later Upanis\u0323ads were developed to propound the concepts of certain famous schools, such as Yoga, Veda\u0304nta, S\u0341a\u0304kta, Vais\u0323n\u0323ava and S\u0341aiva.\nA\u0304rs\u0323eyaUpanis\u0323ad is a Veda\u0304ntic Upanis\u0323ad which describes well-established doctrine of Veda\u0304nta in simple and general way. According to its name, it is \u2018related with R\u0323s\u0323is\u2019and we find here five seers \u2013 Vis\u0341va\u0304mitra, Jamadagni, Bharadva\u0304ja, Gautama, and Vasis\u0323t\u0323ha explaining some philosophical concepts in conversation with others. \u2018One entity resides in all beings, it is A\u0304tman, it is eternal, it is in the form of light. Its glory (Mahima\u0304) cannot be attained.\u2019 These concepts are described by seers variously and vividly. The principle of \u2018netineti\u2019 too is referred. The Upanis\u0323ad concludes with namah\u0323 to Agni, Indra, Praja\u0304pati and Brahman.\nThis is a short Upanis\u0323ad written in prose form and have three verses in its concluding part. It is without any division or parts. The language of A\u0304rs\u0323eya Upanis\u0323ad reminds us Vedic Bra\u0304hman\u0329a texts.\nSamhita\nKauthuma Samhita (Samaveda)\nBrahmanas\nTandya Brahmana\nSadavinsa Brahmana\nSamavidhana Brahmana\nAarseya Brahmana\nDevatadhyaya Brahmana\nChandogya Brahmana\nSamhitopanisad Brahmana\nVansha Brahmana\nAranyaka\nTalavakararanyaka\nTop\nSocial Sidebar\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser to view the content",
