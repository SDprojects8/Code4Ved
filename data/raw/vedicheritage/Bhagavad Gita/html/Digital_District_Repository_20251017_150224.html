Digital District Repository
Introduction
The big stories often make the headlines of our historical narratives, but history is not only about the landmark events - it finds shape and character in the myriad events that led up to a flashpoint of change. An attempt to discover and document stories of people, events, and places linked to the freedom struggle of India at the micro level of the district has led to the creation of a Digital District Repository. Stories in this section can be broadly classified under - People & Personalities, Events & Happenings, Hidden treasures â€“ Built & Natural Heritage, and Living Traditions & Art Forms.
