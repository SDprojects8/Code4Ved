# Project Estimates

## Document Information
**Project**: Code4Ved - Vedic Texts Analysis Platform  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2025-10-04  
**Estimator**: Sumit Das  
**Estimation Method**: Expert Judgment + Historical Data + Three-Point Estimation

## Estimation Approach
This estimation combines expert judgment based on research findings, historical data from similar projects, and three-point estimation (optimistic, most likely, pessimistic) to provide realistic effort and duration estimates for the Code4Ved project.
