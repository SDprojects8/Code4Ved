# Project Charter

## Project Information
**Project Name**: Code4Ved - Vedic Texts Analysis Platform
**Project Code**: C4V-001
**Charter Date**: 2025-04-18
**Charter Version**: 1.0
**Project Manager**: Self-Directed Learning Project
**Project Sponsor**: Personal Development Initiative

## Executive Summary
Code4Ved is a comprehensive digital platform that combines programming expertise with the study of ancient Indian texts (Vedas, Puranas, Upanishads). The project aims to create a modern, accessible, and analytically rich environment for exploring Vedic literature through web scraping, database design, natural language processing, and knowledge graph visualization. This initiative bridges ancient wisdom with modern technology, creating tools for text analysis, classification, and conceptual exploration.

## Project Purpose and Justification
### Business Need
Ancient Sanskrit texts are scattered across multiple websites, in various formats, and lack unified classification systems. Students, researchers, and enthusiasts face challenges in accessing, organizing, and analyzing these texts systematically. There is a gap between traditional study methods and modern computational tools that could enhance understanding and accessibility.

### Project Purpose
To create a comprehensive digital infrastructure that:
- Centralizes access to Vedic literature from multiple sources
- Provides structured classification and searchable databases
- Enables NLP-based analysis of philosophical concepts
- Visualizes relationships between ancient wisdom and modern science
- Develops programming skills in Python, SQL, web scraping, NLP, and graph databases

### Project Justification
- **Educational Value**: Makes ancient texts more accessible to modern learners
- **Cultural Preservation**: Digitizes and preserves cultural heritage
- **Technical Innovation**: Applies cutting-edge NLP and database technologies to traditional texts
- **Skill Development**: Provides practical experience in Python, GoLang, Rust, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Neo4j
- **Knowledge Integration**: Creates bridges between philosophy, spirituality, and modern science

## Project Objectives
### Primary Objectives
- Create a comprehensive database of Vedas, Puranas, Upanishads, epic poems, and Samhitas
- Build automated web scraping tools to extract texts from major Sanskrit repositories
- Develop NLP pipeline for Sanskrit text analysis and concept extraction
- Implement knowledge graph database connecting philosophical concepts with modern science
- Design learning path visualization following GitHub roadmap patterns

### Success Criteria
- Successfully extract and classify 100+ texts from at least 10 major Sanskrit websites
- Database contains texts classified by language, format, category, concepts, and themes
- NLP tools achieve >80% accuracy in concept extraction and classification
- Knowledge graph contains >500 nodes and >1000 relationships
- Interactive learning roadmap flowchart created and accessible
- Project codebase well-documented and reusable for future enhancements
