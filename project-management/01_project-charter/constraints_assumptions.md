**Author**: Sumit Das

## Project Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- **Development Environment**: Personal development machine with Python, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Neo4j
- **Internet Access**: Required for web scraping and accessing text repositories
- **Storage**: Local storage for databases and extracted texts
- **Processing Power**: Single-machine processing for NLP and analysis tasks
- **Database Licenses**: Open-source databases only (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Neo4j Community Edition)

### Resource Constraints
- **Budget**: $100 maximum for learning resources (books, courses)
- **Time**: 10-15 hours per week for 12 months (520-780 total hours)
- **Personnel**: Single developer (self-directed learning project)
- **Infrastructure**: Personal development environment only

### Legal and Ethical Constraints
- **Copyright Compliance**: Only use public domain or openly licensed texts
- **Web Scraping Ethics**: Respect robots.txt, implement rate limiting, proper attribution
- **Data Privacy**: Single-user system, no personal data collection
- **Attribution**: Maintain source attribution for all extracted texts

### Quality Constraints
- **Text Accuracy**: >95% accuracy for manual validation samples
- **Classification Accuracy**: >80% accuracy for automated concept extraction
- **Source Attribution**: 100% of texts must have source URL
- **Metadata Completeness**: All required fields populated

### Timeline Constraints
- **Project Duration**: 12 months maximum
- **Milestone Deadlines**: Quarterly milestone reviews
- **Learning Curve**: Progressive technology adoption (Python â†’ GoLang/Rust)
- **Scope Management**: Strict prioritization to avoid scope creep

## Project Assumptions

### Technical Assumptions
- **Text Sources**: Target websites will remain accessible and stable
- **Format Support**: PDF, HTML, and plain text formats will be sufficient
- **NLP Accuracy**: English translations will provide adequate NLP results
- **Database Performance**: Local databases will handle expected data volumes
- **Development Tools**: Open-source tools will meet all requirements

### Resource Assumptions
- **Time Availability**: Consistent 10-15 hours per week available
- **Learning Capacity**: Ability to learn new technologies progressively
- **Internet Access**: Reliable internet connection for web scraping
- **Hardware**: Development machine sufficient for all required software

### Data Assumptions
- **Text Quality**: Source texts will be of sufficient quality for analysis
- **Translation Availability**: English translations available for most texts
- **Concept Coverage**: Core philosophical concepts identifiable across texts
- **Source Reliability**: Government and academic sources will be most reliable

### Project Assumptions
- **Scope Stability**: Core requirements will not change significantly
- **Technology Learning**: New technologies (GoLang, Rust) can be learned incrementally
- **Community Support**: Open-source community will provide necessary support
- **Documentation**: Self-documentation will be sufficient for project continuity

### Business Assumptions
- **Copyright Status**: Texts from government and academic sources are public domain
- **Website Access**: Target websites will allow ethical scraping
- **Data Volume**: Expected data volumes manageable with chosen technologies
- **User Base**: Single-user system sufficient for initial implementation

## Risk-Associated Assumptions

### High-Risk Assumptions
- **Website Stability**: Target websites may change structure or become unavailable
- **Copyright Clarity**: Some texts may have unclear copyright status
- **NLP Accuracy**: Sanskrit NLP may be more challenging than anticipated
- **Time Commitment**: Personal schedule may conflict with project timeline

### Medium-Risk Assumptions
- **Technology Learning**: New technologies may take longer to master
- **Data Quality**: Source texts may have varying quality levels
- **Scope Management**: Feature creep may impact timeline
- **Community Engagement**: Limited external validation available

### Low-Risk Assumptions
- **Hardware Sufficiency**: Development machine adequate for all tasks
- **Internet Reliability**: Internet access will be consistent
- **Documentation**: Self-documentation will be comprehensive
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub will provide adequate version control

## Assumption Validation Plan

### Ongoing Validation
- **Weekly**: Review time commitment and progress
- **Monthly**: Validate technical assumptions and data quality
- **Quarterly**: Review scope and timeline assumptions

### Validation Methods
- **Technical**: Regular testing of scrapers and database performance
- **Data**: Manual validation of extracted texts and classifications
- **Timeline**: Monthly progress reviews against milestones
- **Scope**: Regular scope reviews to prevent creep

### Contingency Planning
- **Website Changes**: Maintain backup sources and flexible scrapers
- **Copyright Issues**: Focus on verified public domain sources
- **Time Constraints**: Adjust timeline or scope as needed
- **Technical Challenges**: Simplify architecture if needed

## Assumption Dependencies

### Critical Dependencies
- **Text Sources**: Project success depends on accessible, quality text sources
- **Time Availability**: Consistent time commitment essential for success
- **Technology Learning**: Ability to learn new technologies progressively

### Important Dependencies
- **Internet Access**: Required for web scraping and research
- **Hardware Performance**: Adequate processing power for NLP tasks
- **Documentation Quality**: Self-documentation critical for project continuity

### Minor Dependencies
- **Community Support**: Helpful but not critical for project success
- **External Validation**: Beneficial but not required for core functionality
- **Advanced Features**: Nice-to-have but not essential for MVP

## Assumption Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- **Time Tracking**: Weekly hours committed vs. planned
- **Technical Progress**: Milestone completion rates
- **Data Quality**: Accuracy of extracted texts and classifications
- **Scope Management**: Feature requests vs. original scope

### Warning Signs
- **Time Commitment**: Consistent under-commitment of planned hours
- **Technical Blockers**: Inability to complete technical milestones
- **Data Issues**: Poor quality or inaccessible text sources
- **Scope Creep**: Frequent requests for new features

### Response Actions
- **Time Issues**: Adjust timeline or scope as needed
- **Technical Issues**: Seek help or simplify approach
- **Data Issues**: Find alternative sources or adjust expectations
- **Scope Issues**: Strict prioritization and backlog management
