## Code4Ved Project Update

I'm working on a project that combines programming with the study of ancient Indian texts (Vedas, Puranas, Upanishads). The project involves:

- Web scraping from Sanskrit text repositories
- Multi-database architecture (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Neo4j)
- NLP analysis for concept extraction
- Knowledge graph visualization
- Learning roadmap generation

I'm looking for feedback on [specific aspect] and would appreciate any insights from the community.
