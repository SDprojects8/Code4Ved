# Project Scope Statement

## Project Information
**Project Name**: Code4Ved - Vedic Texts Analysis Platform  
**Date**: 2025-10-04  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Prepared By**: Sumit Das  

## Project Scope Description
Code4Ved is a comprehensive digital platform that combines programming expertise with the study of ancient Indian texts (Vedas, Puranas, Upanishads). The project creates a modern, accessible, and analytically rich environment for exploring Vedic literature through web scraping, database design, natural language processing, and knowledge graph visualization. This initiative bridges ancient wisdom with modern technology, creating tools for text analysis, classification, and conceptual exploration.

## Project Deliverables
### Major Deliverables
- **Web Scraping Module**: Python/GoLang/Rust scripts for automated text extraction from 15+ Sanskrit repositories
- **Multi-Database Architecture**: PostgreSQL for structured metadata, MongoDB for unstructured annotations, Neo4j for concept relationships
- **NLP Analysis Pipeline**: Python-based text analysis tools using NLTK, spaCy for concept extraction and topic modeling
- **Knowledge Graph**: Visual representation of relationships between philosophical concepts and modern science
- **Learning Roadmap**: Interactive flowchart following GitHub roadmap patterns for systematic study
- **Documentation Suite**: Technical documentation, user guides, API references, and code repository

### Acceptance Criteria
| Deliverable | Acceptance Criteria |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Web Scraping Module | Successfully extract texts from 10+ websites, handle PDF/HTML/text formats, respect robots.txt |
| Database Architecture | PostgreSQL schema with 5+ tables, MongoDB for annotations, Neo4j with 500+ nodes and 1000+ relationships |
| NLP Pipeline | Extract 20+ philosophical concepts with >80% accuracy, topic modeling across text corpus |
| Knowledge Graph | Connect ancient concepts to modern science, visualize relationships, support graph queries |
| Learning Roadmap | Mermaid diagram showing text progression, exportable as SVG/PNG, interactive navigation |
| Documentation | Complete technical docs, user guides, API references, well-organized GitHub repository |

## Project Boundaries

### In Scope
*What the project will include*
- Web scraping from identified Sanskrit text repositories (vedicheritage.gov.in, gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de, sanskritdocuments.org, sacred-texts.com, ambuda.org)
- Text extraction from PDFs, HTML, and plain text sources
- Multi-dimensional classification (language, format, category, concepts, themes)
- Database design and implementation (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Neo4j)
- NLP analysis (keyword extraction, topic modeling, concept identification)
- Knowledge graph implementation connecting philosophical concepts to modern science
- Visualization tools (Mermaid charts, learning roadmaps, concept graphs)
- Documentation and code repository with version control
- Learning path visualization following GitHub roadmap patterns
- Integration of programming skills development with Vedic studies

### Out of Scope
*What the project will NOT include*
- Sanskrit-to-English translation engine (use existing translations)
- Mobile application development
- Real-time collaborative editing features
- Commercial distribution or monetization
- Audio/video content analysis
- User authentication system (single-user focus)
- Real-time translation services
- Commercial API development
- Multi-user collaboration features
- Mobile app development

### Future Considerations
*Items that may be addressed in future phases*
- Web-based user interface for broader accessibility
- Integration with Sanskrit NLP APIs
- Mobile application for text reading
- Real-time collaborative annotation features
- Advanced visualization dashboards
- API development for external integrations
- Machine learning model training on Sanskrit texts
- Integration with existing Sanskrit study platforms

## Scope Change Control
### Change Request Process
1. Document change request with impact analysis
2. Evaluate impact on timeline and resources
3. Review with project owner (self)
4. Update project documentation
5. Implement approved changes

### Change Authority
| Change Type | Approval Authority |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Minor (scope clarification, documentation updates) | Project Manager (Self) |
| Major (new features, technology changes) | Project Manager (Self) with documentation |
| Scope changes affecting core objectives | Project Manager (Self) with impact analysis |

## Scope Validation
**Validation Method**: Self-review against project objectives and success criteria
**Validation Frequency**: Monthly during active development
**Validation Criteria**:
